# Changelog

This file records notable user-facing changes to egglog-experimental.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- A `Maybe[T]` sort with construction, partial unwrapping, defaulting,
  undefined-result capture, and higher-order branching. When more than one
  nominal `Maybe` alias is compatible, `maybe-none` requires type context.
- `map-fold-kv` for folding Map entries in opaque, EGraph-local stored `Value`
  order. Callbacks should be order-insensitive; an undefined callback makes the
  whole fold undefined.
- `f64-is-finite`, a predicate for guarding computations that may produce NaN
  or infinite values.
- A `:node-limit N` option for the `back-off` scheduler: once an observed count
  reaches this soft threshold, further rules are delayed. Each check sees
  earlier rule actions, but one rule may add any number of nodes and the
  deferred rebuild may change the count again.
- The `(get-node-size!)` primitive: the visible e-node count of an
  ordinary experimental e-graph, excluding relations, analysis functions,
  global aliases, hidden declarations, and internal-prefixed implementation
  tables. This is the same measure `:node-limit` uses there.
- A `:dag` option for `multi-extract` that let-binds subterms shared across
  the extracted variants instead of expanding every variant to a tree.
- Greedy DAG extraction for `extract`, `multi-extract`, and `keep-best` via
  `:extractor greedy-dag`.
- `(unstable-subst root map)`, which copies the affected portion of the
  constructor sub-e-graph reachable from `root` with each key e-class replaced
  by its mapped value, preserving subsumed rows and making subsumption dominant
  on copy collisions. Available in top-level actions and `:naive` rule heads;
  anchorless affected cycles fail before copy writes.

`Maybe` operations and `map-fold-kv` are not currently supported in proof mode.

### Changed

- `MultiExtractOutput`, the single aggregate output returned by `multi-extract`,
  now publicly exposes its shared `TermDag` as `termdag` and its ordered
  per-root term IDs as `terms`. Consumers can recover it by downcasting the
  user-defined command output. Unextractable roots retain an empty group.
- The `back-off` scheduler now rejects unknown option tags instead of silently
  ignoring misspellings or removed options.
- `keep-best` now honors dynamic costs assigned by `set-cost` in both tree and
  greedy-DAG extraction modes.
- `keep-best` rejects calls without a target table before mutating the e-graph.

### Fixed

- Subsuming a constructor row created earlier in the same rule or in
  `EGraph::update` now works through the updated egglog dependency.

## [3.0.0] - 2026-08-20

This is the first crates.io release of egglog-experimental. Its major version
matches egglog 3, with which it is compatible.

### Added

- An extended scheduling language with named back-off schedulers, sequencing,
  saturation, repetition, full-context expression evaluation, and command steps.
- Dynamic extraction costs, multi-term/multi-variant extraction, and `keep-best`
  compaction.
- Body-defined primitives, one-shot `for` rules, grouped `with-ruleset`
  declarations, and fresh values in rule actions.
- Exact rational values and their arithmetic, comparison, rounding, partial
  power/root, and conversion primitives.
- E-graph table-size queries and per-table column and out-degree statistics.
- The `egglog-experimental` command-line program and
  `new_experimental_egraph` Rust entry point.
