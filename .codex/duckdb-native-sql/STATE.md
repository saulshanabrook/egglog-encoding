# DuckDB Native SQL Goal State

Updated: 2026-07-28 America/New_York

## Mission

Implement a benchmark-first, proof-agnostic, fully typed DuckDB backend on
current `origin/main`. DuckDB is authoritative for function rows and executes
matching, merges, effects, containers, and rebuild through generated SQL or
safe public vector UDFs. The five frozen non-Herbie proof-mode workloads must
statically lower with no host matching/merge fallback; bounded semantic gates
are blocking, while full-workload timeouts are censored performance results.

## Non-goals and accepted no-go facts

- Do not base the implementation on PR 22, the causal-slicing branches, or a
  dirty donor worktree. They are behavioral or historical oracles only.
- Do not patch or fork `duckdb-rs`; do not use `duckdb::ffi`, private handles,
  transmutation, or backend-owned unsafe code.
- Do not add Appender, Arrow-Appender, `read_csv`, or `COPY` in this goal.
- Rust-parsed input values are rendered with one central, type-aware,
  injection-safe SQL literal encoder and inlined into generated `VALUES` or
  effect SQL. Bound parameters are not the accepted input-ingestion path.
- Do not create ART indexes for ordinary function storage by default, including
  indirectly through `PRIMARY KEY` or `UNIQUE` constraints. Any later index
  must re-enter through measured evidence; correctness uses full typed SQL
  equality and relational consolidation.
- Do not retain a production host matcher, host merge evaluator, function-row
  mirror, or proof-aware storage path.
- Proof-encoding relations and proof IDs are ordinary program data. Durable
  per-row backend metadata is only generation and subsumption state.
- Full `UnstableFn`, causal receipts/replay, Windows support, every example,
  and a standalone full-Math SQL program are outside the blocking scope.
- No subprocess may run longer than 115 seconds.
- Do not push or open a pull request without explicit user approval.

## Semantic canary contract

The backend remains proof-agnostic, but its ordinary relational behavior must
preserve these current SPI semantics:

- one bounded rules run reads a stable pre-wave snapshot; writes become match
  inputs only in a later iteration;
- effects preserve source action order within a firing and flush in
  delete, then set/merge, then subsume order;
- lookup is read-only; repeated lookup-or-insert misses in one action stream
  share one predicted row; a subsumed row still satisfies lookup;
- merge arguments are atomic old/new row snapshots, and merge dependencies and
  rebuilds run to fixed point;
- remove-then-reinsert of an equal logical row is a fresh seminaive event;
- Live, All, and Subsumed reads remain distinct, and subsumption does not erase
  the current function mapping;
- `clone_boxed` produces an independent backend-visible snapshot for push/pop;
- no total global match order is invented beyond guaranteed local action and
  phase ordering;
- causal receipts/history remain optional and out of scope unless explicitly
  advertised by the backend.

## Steering frame

- **Current frontier:** checkpoints 0 and 0.5 are implemented on current main.
  The workspace has DuckDB-authoritative typed scalar storage/input, a safe
  nonbundled runtime path, a truthful fallible native-input SPI, and a narrow
  production `RuleSpec` compiler. Live table bodies with typed
  variables/literals and one Set into a one-output `MergeFn::Old` target execute
  through generated SQL with stable pre-wave staging and transactional effects.
  The next frontier is a read-only first-failure census through the public
  proof-mode path for all five frozen workloads; it will select the smallest
  real checkpoint-1 breadth slice before another writer is seated.
- **Scoreboard:** current-main pinned; proof gate green (212/212); safe prebuilt
  runtime is DuckDB v1.5.4; DuckDB backend tests 19/19, bridge 26/26,
  proof-mode regression 12/12, DD 38/38, and feature-enabled CLI 4/4 passed.
  Reduced Pointer five-way and Math Add-swap production differentials agree
  with main across initial, fresh-delta, and no-delta transcripts. Independent
  checkpoint-0.5 implementation review found no code or semantic defect and
  requested only this stale-ledger reconciliation.
- **Progress signal:** a reviewable production slice plus exact capped command
  evidence that advances one checkpoint gate.
- **No movement:** no reviewable patch, no new reproducible evidence, and no
  decision-narrowing result. A falsified hypothesis counts as movement.
- **Two-cycle trigger:** after two consecutive same-domain no-movement cycles,
  freeze implementation, preserve evidence, and run one bounded
  Understand/Explore/Decide reassessment before resuming.
- **Active risks:** typed nested value boundary limitations in safe public
  `duckdb-rs`; reference native input clones a quiescent bridge state per batch
  for rollback correctness; DuckDB `clone_boxed` still requires a deep database
  snapshot; scheduler rollback currently downcasts to the reference backend;
  proof-instrumented primitive breadth; order-sensitive merge semantics; the
  benchmark harness does not yet advertise the DuckDB endpoint; slow bounded
  proof workloads.
- **Next decision:** use exact public-path failures from the five frozen
  proof-mode workloads to choose one bounded checkpoint-1 writer contract.
  Preserve UnstableFn as schema-only deferred unless a frozen workload actually
  constructs or applies it. Do not infer complete-program support from the two
  reduced checkpoint-0.5 differentials.

## Roster

| Agent | Circle/domain | Aim | Authority and write set | Expected output | Stop |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `/root` | coordinator | preserve mission, integrate checkpoints, own broad/final commands and user communication | shared ledger, diff review, final gates, narrow recorded integration repairs only after worker is seated | accepted checkpoint and next bounded slice | goal completes, evidence rejects architecture, or user decision is required |
| `/root/fallible_input_worker` | checkpoint 0 implementation | deliver the reassessment-authorized fallible native-input boundary | explicitly authorized bridge/backend-trait/frontend/DD/DuckDB files; targeted commands only | accepted fallible-input patch and exact command evidence | completed with independent PASS |
| `/root/rule_sql_worker` | checkpoint 0.5 implementation | deliver the smallest production SQL-native rule compiler plus real main differentials | DuckDB crate and focused tests only; no shared SPI/frontend edits without a stop-and-review | table-only/Set-only compiler, Pointer/Math transcripts, exact gate evidence | completed; both differentials and canaries pass |
| `/root/primary_lowering_frontier` | checkpoint 1 read-only diagnosis | locate the first unsupported production surface for each frozen proof-mode workload | no writes; public paths, static/desugar evidence, and focused capped probes only | exact failure matrix and one bounded next writer contract | one evidence-backed frontier or an architectural blocker |
| `/root/checkpoint_reviewer` | independent read-only review | evaluate checkpoint artifacts against scope, safety, semantics, and evidence rubric | no writes; raw diff and raw artifacts only | `PASS`, `REVISE`, or `REASSESS` with live issues separated from stale feedback | one evidence-backed verdict and one bounded re-review if needed |

No overlapping writing worker may be added. Read-only specialist circles may
be seated only for disjoint evidence questions with explicit stop terms.

## Worker contract: checkpoint 0/0.5

- **Hypothesis:** current-main's `Backend`/`RuleSpec` and encoded bulk-input
  surfaces can host a fresh, proof-agnostic DuckDB crate using only safe public
  APIs, with typed SQL storage and no host row mirror.
- **Target artifact:** a minimal workspace-integrated DuckDB backend skeleton
  plus safe API/type/input/kernel probes sufficient to decide the next vertical
  slice; no speculative full compiler rewrite before the probes pass.
- **Expected delta:** `--backend duckdb` is registered behind a feature, the
  crate installs typed scalar tables and transactions, and focused probes prove
  generated SQL `VALUES`, rollback, nested output projection, and representative
  selective/broad match SQL behavior.
- **Owned write set:** root `Cargo.toml`/`Cargo.lock` and, for the first repair,
  root `Makefile` gate wiring;
  `egglog-experimental/Cargo.toml`; `egglog-experimental/src/main.rs`; and new
  `egglog-experimental/duckdb/{Cargo.toml,src/lib.rs,src/storage.rs,
  PRIMARY_SURFACE_CENSUS.md}` with focused probes. No backend-trait or frontend
  changes were authorized in the initial slice; the later recorded reassessment
  explicitly authorized the bridge/backend-trait/frontend/DD input boundary.
- **Forbidden shortcuts:** old downstream-only helpers, bridge authority,
  function-row mirrors, host matching/merge, Appender/file-reader ingestion,
  proof-specific branches, unsafe/private DuckDB APIs, fixture weakening, or
  snapshot masking.
- **Owned commands:** targeted `cargo check`/unit tests and reduced probes, each
  with an external 115-second watchdog.
- **Request-only commands:** full `make check`, `make proof-tests`, and the
  five-workload benchmark matrix; coordinator owns final-gate reruns.
- **Evidence contract:** command, cwd, SHA, features, inputs, exit status,
  duration, artifact/report path, and whether the result is fresh or inherited.
- **Stop:** pass the slice gates; falsify the architectural hypothesis; hit a
  required user decision; or reach two no-movement cycles.

## Review rubric

An advancing checkpoint receives independent read-only review of:

1. owned-path scope and preservation of unrelated changes;
2. safe documented DuckDB APIs and absence of unsafe/private escape hatches;
3. DuckDB authority and absence of proof-specific or host-match/merge fallback;
4. semantic/error/rollback coverage, including input and generation behavior;
5. raw diff, commands, reports, provenance, timeouts, and cache isolation;
6. repository-prescribed checks appropriate to the checkpoint.

One worker repair and re-review is allowed. A second rejection changes the
frontier to reassessment rather than another micro-variant.

## First bounded repair contract

- Add one central type-aware, injection-safe SQL literal encoder and use it for
  all Rust-parsed input rows. Inline typed `VALUES`; production ingestion must
  contain neither placeholders nor `params_from_iter`. Cover adversarial UTF-8
  strings (quotes, comment/statement text, NUL, Unicode), integer extrema, and
  floating-point finite/signed-zero/NaN/infinity cases.
- Remove every `PRIMARY KEY`/`UNIQUE` constraint and ART index from ordinary
  function tables. Preserve first-incoming-row-wins and existing-row-wins with
  ordinal `row_number` plus full typed-equality `NOT EXISTS` consolidation in
  the same serial transaction. Assert zero ordinary function indexes. Replace
  the rollback test's unique-index fault with an index-free constraint fault.
- Make bundled DuckDB explicitly opt-in. `duckdb-backend` activates the
  dependency without forcing bundled, and repository gates exercise the
  feature-enabled CLI/backend through `DUCKDB_DOWNLOAD_LIB=1`. Do not attempt
  another bundled build in this repair.
- Do not latch `changed` after `add_values`, which already flushes. Add a
  regression asserting the following `flush_updates` is false.
- Surface stored input errors at the next observable backend operation rather
  than only at a later nonempty `run_rules`; add an input-only failure test.
- Re-run the focused prebuilt tests/checks under the 110-second command cap and
  reconcile this ledger. Do not claim the checkpoint 0.5 kernel gate: the
  existing Pointer/Math SQL tests remain useful feasibility evidence only.

## Reassessment decision: fallible native input

- Change `Backend::add_values` to return `anyhow::Result<()>` and update the
  reference adapter, DD backend, and DuckDB backend. This is the narrow shared
  API change justified by the second-cycle evidence.
- Have `native_input` propagate the backend error as `Error::BackendError`
  before emitting its success log. This makes direct frontend input and input
  inside `(fail ...)` truthful without depending on a later maintenance run.
- The reference adapter calls bridge `try_add_values`: it flushes and validates
  preexisting staged work, clones only a quiescent bridge state, and restores
  that checkpoint on a batch merge failure. DD returns its existing fallible
  merge-aware `apply_sets`; DuckDB returns its transactional `insert_batch`
  result directly.
- Remove input failures from DuckDB's deferred-panic latch. Retain a separate
  deferred rule-panic channel for `Backend::new_panic`, whose documented
  delivery boundary remains `run_rules`.
- Diagnostics must never consume a deferred rule error. `runtime_version` is a
  provenance helper, not an error-delivery boundary; `dump_debug_info` may
  report pending diagnostics but must leave the channel intact.
- Focused gates must cover immediate input error propagation, rollback and
  continued usability, DD/reference compilation, and `(fail ...)` propagation
  at the frontend boundary. No bundled build is authorized.

## Worker contract: checkpoint 0.5 production RuleSpec slice

- **Hypothesis:** current `RuleSpec` and safe public DuckDB APIs can execute a
  useful production subset entirely through generated SQL: one or more Live
  table atoms with typed variables/literals and exactly one table Set head into
  a one-output `MergeFn::Old` target. No shared SPI change is required.
- **Target artifact:** `duckdb/src/rule_sql.rs` plus the smallest storage/runtime
  additions and focused differential tests. `add_rule` validates and compiles;
  `run_rules` materializes every scheduled rule's matches before applying any
  effect, applies stages in scheduled rule order inside one transaction, and
  updates per-rule generation watermarks only after commit.
- **Required semantics:** stable pre-wave reads; Live filtering; repeated
  variables and literals lowered with typed `IS NOT DISTINCT FROM`; ordinary
  identifiers remain numeric/compiler-owned; literals use the existing central
  encoder; no SQL placeholders; no ordinary indexes; first existing/incoming
  row wins under KeepOld; second no-delta run reports unchanged; fresh rows in
  any body relation can join older rows in the others; rollback leaves target
  rows, generation, stages, and watermarks unchanged.
- **Supported IR only:** nonempty table-call bodies, variables/literals, Live
  read mode, one table Set action, all head variables bound, exact arity/types,
  and one-output `MergeFn::Old`. Fail closed on primitives, globals, lets,
  changes, unions, panics, non-Live reads, empty bodies, multiple heads,
  unbound variables, freed IDs, and every other merge/action form.
- **Differential gate:** build logically identical, backend-local typed
  `RuleSpec`s for main and DuckDB; never replay backend-local IDs or Values.
  Source-pin the Pointer five-way rule at
  `benchmarks/pointer-analysis-small.egg` and the Math Add commutativity rule at
  `egglog/tests/math-microbenchmark.egg`. Compare sorted typed witness rows and
  changed/no-change transcripts across initial, fresh-delta, and no-delta runs.
  Handwritten SQL probes remain feasibility-only until these pass.
- **Canaries:** a two-rule seed-to-middle-to-output schedule proves writes from
  one rule are not body inputs to another until the next bounded call; an
  unsupported-IR matrix proves fail-closed admission; a test-only later-target
  failure proves transaction and watermark rollback; generated SQL contains no
  `?` and no user-derived identifiers; catalog remains free of ordinary ART
  indexes/key constraints.
- **Owned write set:** `egglog-experimental/duckdb/Cargo.toml`, new
  `egglog-experimental/duckdb/src/rule_sql.rs`, existing DuckDB `lib.rs` and
  `storage.rs`, and focused DuckDB tests such as
  `tests/rule_differential.rs`. Dev-only dependencies are allowed. Stop before
  editing the shared backend trait, frontend, bridge, DD backend, fixtures, or
  benchmark harness.
- **Bounded performance evidence:** after correctness, one fixed-size Pointer
  and one fixed-size Math probe, at most one warm-up plus three measurements,
  with setup and bounded rule execution separated. No speed threshold and no
  tuning loop; a timeout is censored evidence.
- **Owned commands:** targeted DuckDB differential/unit tests, formatting, and
  scoped clippy under a 110-second external watchdog through the nonbundled
  `DUCKDB_DOWNLOAD_LIB=1` path. No bundled command or broad benchmark matrix.
- **Stop:** both production differentials and semantic canaries pass; two
  materially different SQL formulations disagree with main; safe public APIs
  cannot provide atomic staging; Rust would need to enumerate matches/retain
  rows; a shared-SPI expansion becomes necessary; or the two-cycle trigger
  fires.

## Next action

Keep the checkpoint-0.5 implementation frozen except for the requested durable
state/census reconciliation, obtain an exact documentation-only re-review, and
commit the accepted slice locally without pushing. Use the read-only primary
lowering frontier to define the smallest checkpoint-1 implementation contract;
do not start from speculative all-container or all-primitive breadth.
